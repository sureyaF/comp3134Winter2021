1. When I typed Ben I got no result because active = 0 for Ben inside the database, but search looks for active = 1. 

2. I couldn't find a result to my request as the input I used is out of the list in the database/records. 

3.I could see all the infos from the database records because it isn't sanitized and this can be easily exploited.

My Observations:

1) directly links to the word "hello" definition

2. url presents misspelling?term=abcxyz meaning there's no definition for the word "abcxyz" 

3. <script>alert(%27hello%27)</script> query is converted to a string, thus not running the javascript code and returning specific words that are known (alert and hello)

4. same results as above, returns known words and ignores <script> tag
